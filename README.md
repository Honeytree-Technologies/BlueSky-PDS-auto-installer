# BlueSky-PDS Deployment and Hardening Script

This script automates the initial deployment and security hardening of BlueSky-PDS and its components using Docker and bash scripting. 

It's a free Bash script that simplifies BlueSky-PDS installation and enhances security with a single command. Whether you're setting up a new server or upgrading an existing one, this script is suitable for all levels of Bluesky-social/PDS server owners. It handles the entire installation process, including activating the admin user, securing the server by changing the SSH port, installing a firewall, updating firewall rules, and setting up Fail2Ban for progressive blocking. 

The unencrypted Bash file is freely usable and redistributable, with credit to Honeytree Technologies required.


## About the Script

- **Language**: Bash
- **Deployment**: Uses Docker images for deploying BlueSky-PDS containers.
- **Configuration**:
  - SSL certificate generation via Let's Encrypt for designated domains and Nginx setup.

## Pre-requisites

- Server or VPS with a minimum of 4GB Ram, 2 vCPU, and 65 GB storage.
- Ubuntu v20.04 LTS pre-installed.
- Open ports:  443, 80 and SSH (Which you will choose in the script).
- Machine should have internet access for fetching packages and Docker images.
- Pre-register the machine's IP with the domain for SSL certificate generation.

## Deployment Steps

1. SSH into the machine and assume root privileges.
2. Create and navigate to a directory: `mkdir auto_script && cd auto_script`.
    You can also use own directory.
3. Run the following command to start the script.
    ```bash
    curl -lO https://code.honeytreetech.com/fediverse/BlueSky-PDS/auto-installer/auto_script.sh && sudo chmod +x auto_script.sh && ./auto_script.sh
    ```
4. Input the requested details as per the following table.
    | Name | Description | Mandatory | Optional | Default Value | 
    |------|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|
    |`db_user` | Database user | &checkmark;|  &#10006;| pds| 
    |`db_password` | Database password| &checkmark;| &#10006;| pass_XXXXXXXXX (whereX is Random character)|
    |`db_name` | Database name| &#10006;| &checkmark;|pds_XXXXXXXXX (whereX is Random character) |
    |`domain_name` | Domain name| &checkmark;| &#10006;| &#10006;|
    |`port` | SSH port | &checkmark;| &#10006;| &#10006;|

                                
5. Accept terms of service as prompted.
6. Create Invite code  and  Admin password during installation of script.
7. Follow further on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

## Post Deployment

- Access BlueSky-PDS via the provided domain with the given admin password and invite code .
- SSH port defaults to new port (which you entered in the script).
- fail2ban is activated with progressive blocking.

## Post-Installation Security Recommendations

Once you have successfully deployed BlueSky-PDS using this script, it's crucial to take additional steps to secure and harden your environment. 

Consider the following actions:

- **Regular Updates**: Ensure that all system packages and software are regularly updated to patch potential vulnerabilities.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Fine-tune your firewall settings to allow only necessary traffic and block potential threats.
- **User Access**: Limit or disable root access. Use sudo for administrative tasks and avoid using the root account for daily tasks.
- **Secure Passwords**: Implement strong password policies, and consider using password managers.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Where possible, enable 2FA for critical services and accounts.
- **Backup**: Regularly back up critical data and ensure backups are stored securely.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Set up monitoring and logging to detect and alert on suspicious activities.
- **Application-Specific Security**: Explore and implement security best practices specifically tailored to  BlueSky-PDS and any other applications you might be running.
- **Review and Audit**: Periodically review and audit your security settings and practices to ensure they are up-to-date with the latest threats and vulnerabilities.

It's essential to recognize that the security landscape is dynamic. Stay informed, and be proactive in securing your digital assets.
